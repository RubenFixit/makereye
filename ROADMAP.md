# MakerEye Roadmap

This tracks milestone status, ordering, and what each milestone must
deliver to count as done. See `DESIGN.md` for architecture and
`docs/NEXT_SESSION.md` for the most recent session handoff.

## Design priorities

These apply across every milestone:

1. **Everyday use must not need a terminal.** One-time setup and
   configuration over SSH is fine (install, editing `config.yaml`);
   day-to-day operation is not allowed to require a shell. Milestones 1
   and 2 already meet this bar: once configured, streaming and Prusa
   Connect uploads just run, and you watch them in VLC, a browser, or
   the Prusa Connect dashboard. The rule for new milestones: any
   control an operator is expected to touch routinely (start a
   timelapse, turn a light on) ships with a no-shell interface
   (MQTT/Home Assistant, and later the local web UI) in the same
   milestone — "CLI now, MQTT later" deferrals are not allowed.
2. **Home Assistant integration is a focus — and strictly optional.**
   Core features (streaming, Prusa Connect uploads, lighting,
   timelapses) work out of the box with no Home Assistant and no MQTT
   broker; HA integration is a first-class way to operate and automate
   MakerEye, never a requirement for it. Within that boundary, HA is
   the preferred automation surface: behaviors that *compose* MakerEye's
   features (lighting schedules, notifications, custom triggers) belong
   in HA automations over the entities MakerEye exposes, not
   reimplemented inside MakerEye — but when something is core rather
   than compositional, it gets built in and the HA recipe becomes an
   alternative, not the only path (see Milestone 6 for an example of
   this split).
3. **Lighting is part of image quality.** Snapshots, streams, and
   timelapses are only as good as the scene lighting, so lighting
   control is a first-class (optional) subsystem with pluggable
   backends (see Milestone 4), not an afterthought. The first supported
   light is the Wyze Cam v3 Spotlight Kit — an off-the-shelf, cheap
   (~$8 on sale as of mid-2026), plug-and-play USB accessory whose
   protocol is already reverse-engineered
   (`scripts/spotlight_ctl.sh`); GPIO-driven lights and addressable LED
   strips are planned backend types.

## Contributor guidelines (human or agent)

- **`main` stays releasable.** Every commit on `main` builds, passes
  `make check`, and keeps the docs consistent (README / DESIGN /
  CHANGELOG / example config updated together with the code). Partial
  and exploratory work lives in branches, not on `main`.
- **One milestone per branch/PR.** Don't mix milestones in one change,
  and don't land runtime code for a later milestone while working on an
  earlier one. Config placeholders for future milestones (a section that
  parses and validates but does nothing) are fine and encouraged, so the
  schema doesn't churn.
- **A milestone is complete when**: its features are implemented and
  tested; docs are updated; behavior is validated on real hardware (or
  the unvalidated parts are explicitly flagged as such); and it
  satisfies the everyday-use usability rule in "Design priorities".

## Milestone 0 — Repository foundation — ✅ DONE

- Go module (`github.com/MakerEyeLabs/makereye`), GPLv3 license,
  `.gitignore`, README/DESIGN/ROADMAP/CHANGELOG, example config, systemd
  unit, install/uninstall scripts, Makefile, build-time version support,
  focused tests.
- Added later: `scripts/bootstrap.sh` (build deps for stock Raspberry Pi
  OS Lite) and `scripts/quickstart.sh` (single `curl | sudo bash`
  clone/build/install).

## Milestone 1 — Camera streaming — ✅ DONE

- `internal/config`: schema, defaults, validation, YAML load.
- `internal/camera`: rpicam-vid argument construction.
- `internal/go2rtc`: go2rtc config generation + process supervisor
  (bounded restarts, health check via HTTP).
- `internal/ipc`: Unix socket control protocol (CLI ↔ daemon).
- `internal/daemon`: ties config + supervisor + control socket + signal
  handling together.
- CLI: `run`, `version`, `validate-config`, `status`, `stream
  start/stop/restart`.
- systemd unit + install/uninstall scripts.
- Optional `go2rtc.auth.username`/`password` in `config.yaml`, passed
  through to go2rtc's own RTSP/HTTP API auth, for LAN-exposed setups.
  Password is stored as plaintext deliberately (see `DESIGN.md`
  "Security considerations" for why hashing it would break auth
  entirely).
- **Hardware validation status**: core path confirmed on a real Pi +
  Camera Module 3 (install, service startup, JPEG snapshots, SSH-tunnel
  viewing, LAN RTSP with auth challenge). The full checklist in
  `README.md` "Hardware validation" (reboot persistence, failure/restart
  drills) has not been executed end to end; treat those specific items
  as unverified.

## Milestone 2 — Prusa Connect uploads — ✅ DONE

- `internal/prusaconnect`: `Uploader` captures a JPEG from go2rtc's own
  `/api/frame.jpeg` snapshot endpoint and PUTs it to Prusa Connect's
  webcam ingestion endpoint on an interval (`prusa_connect.interval_seconds`,
  default 10s). Not a subprocess like go2rtc, an in-process goroutine
  loop (see `DESIGN.md` "Prusa Connect uploader").
- Credential flow is manual: no in-app registration/pairing. You create
  the camera in Prusa Connect's web UI (Cameras -> Add camera -> "Other
  camera"), which issues a token, and paste it into
  `prusa_connect.token`. `prusa_connect.fingerprint` is a self-chosen
  stable identifier, not issued by Prusa.
- Endpoint/headers (`PUT https://webcam.connect.prusa3d.com/c/snapshot`,
  `token`/`fingerprint` headers, `image/jpg` content-type) came from a
  working reference script the project owner had used previously against
  the real API, not primary Prusa documentation — the details weren't
  independently verified against Prusa's docs, only against a script
  known to work in practice (and now against MakerEye's own
  implementation working in practice).
- Upload state tracked and inspectable via `makereye status`
  (`prusa_connect: phase=... uploads=... failures=...`) and
  `makereye validate-config` (enabled/disabled + fingerprint, never the
  token).
- Independent start/stop/restart via `makereye prusa start/stop/restart`,
  following the same control-socket pattern as `stream start/stop/restart`
  (new `ipc.CmdPrusaStart/Stop/Restart`).
- Upload failures are logged and retried next interval; they never affect
  camera streaming or crash-loop the daemon, this is an advisory feature.
- `prusa_connect.token` stored as plaintext in `config.yaml` (like
  `go2rtc.auth.password`), see `DESIGN.md` "Security considerations" for
  why, and "Configuration model" for why it isn't split into a separate
  secrets file.
- **Validated against a real Prusa Connect account/camera** (MK4,
  fingerprint/token from a real "Add camera -> Other camera" pairing):
  uploads succeed and the camera registers correctly. One gotcha worth
  recording since it looked like a bug at first: Prusa Connect's web
  dashboard doesn't display webcam footage while the paired printer is
  offline, even if uploads are succeeding, so "camera shows as
  registered but no image" during setup is expected if the printer
  itself isn't on, not a MakerEye or upload problem.

## Milestone 3 — MQTT + Home Assistant integration — ✅ DONE

The usability foundation: everything that was CLI-only (stream
start/stop/restart, prusa start/stop/restart, status) is now operable
from Home Assistant, and later milestones plug new features into the
same plumbing instead of building their own.

- `internal/mqtt.Bridge`: optional advisory in-process subsystem (see
  `DESIGN.md` "MQTT + Home Assistant bridge"). NOT required for core
  operation — daemon starts and streams normally with the broker down;
  paho retries in the background indefinitely.
- Availability topic (retained + LWT), JSON status telemetry (stream
  phase/restarts, Prusa upload/failure counts), republished on every
  command (ack) and every 30s.
- Control mirroring the control-socket commands through the same daemon
  internals: stream and prusa switches (ON/OFF) + restart buttons.
  Prusa entities only published when `prusa_connect.enabled`.
- Home Assistant MQTT discovery (retained, re-published on every
  reconnect): one "MakerEye" device with switches, buttons, and
  sensors, availability wired so entities show unavailable when the
  daemon dies. HA camera entity needs no code — documented in README
  (point Generic Camera at the go2rtc URLs).
- Broker credentials in `config.yaml` under `mqtt:`, same plaintext
  policy and reasoning as the existing credentials.
- Unit-tested against a fake paho client (discovery payloads, command
  dispatch, ack republish, offline LWT behavior); daemon smoke-tested
  against an unreachable broker.
- **Validated against a real Home Assistant + Mosquitto setup**: device
  and all entities appeared via discovery with no HA-side steps,
  switches/buttons control the daemon, sensors track state. Setup
  finding worth recording: a "disconnected (retrying)" state against
  HA's Mosquitto add-on was missing credentials, the add-on rejects
  anonymous connections by default (per README's MQTT section).

## Milestone 4 — Lighting framework + Wyze Spotlight Kit — ✅ DONE

Lighting is a framework with pluggable backends, not a one-off Wyze
integration. The deliverable is the framework plus one working backend
(the Wyze Spotlight Kit), with the config shaped so more backend types
can be added later without breaking existing setups.

- `internal/lighting`: `Manager` (named lights, last-commanded-state
  tracking, "on" restores last non-zero brightness) + `Backend`
  interface (`SetBrightness(0-255)`), kept minimal until a real second
  backend needs more. See `DESIGN.md` "Lighting".
- `lighting:` config section: list of typed lights
  (`type: wyze_spotlight`, per-light `device` defaulting to
  `/dev/ttyUSB0`, `startup_brightness` applied at daemon start since
  the hardware is write-only).
- First backend: **Wyze Cam v3 Spotlight Kit** over USB serial —
  off-the-shelf, cheap (~$8 on sale as of mid-2026), plug-and-play, its
  power passthrough cable even powers the Pi Zero, protocol fully
  reverse-engineered (frame + 16-bit additive checksum, validated on
  real hardware). The Go backend also fixes a latent bug in the
  reference shell script: tty output post-processing is disabled so
  frames containing 0x0A aren't corrupted.
- Future backend types (later contributions, not this milestone): plain
  GPIO on/off, PWM-dimmed GPIO, addressable LED strips (WS2812 etc.).
- Advisory subsystem: unplugged/missing lights are logged and recover
  on the next command (device opened per write); startup-brightness
  failures tolerated; never affects streaming. Daemon shutdown leaves
  lights as-is so restarts/updates don't flap them.
- CLI: `makereye light <name> <0-255|on|off>` via the control socket
  (`ipc.CmdLightSet`).
- MQTT/HA (per the usability rule, same milestone): each configured
  light is a dimmable HA light entity via discovery (state + brightness
  topics, ON restores last brightness).
- `scripts/spotlight_ctl.sh` remains as the standalone/manual tool and
  protocol documentation.
- **Validated on real hardware**: spotlight driven through the daemon
  from the CLI and from Home Assistant (dimmable light entity over
  MQTT), including brightness 10, whose frame contains 0x0A and which
  the reference shell script couldn't send correctly. Setup finding
  fixed during validation: the `makereye` user needed the `dialout`
  group for `/dev/ttyUSB*` access (now granted by the systemd unit and
  the installer).

## Milestone 5 — Manual timelapse — ✅ DONE

Full design in `DESIGN.md` "Timelapse"; summary:

- One active capture job at a time, built on a shared snapshot source
  (`internal/snapshot`, also used by the Prusa uploader) that fetches
  and validates JPEG frames from the go2rtc pipeline — not a second
  camera claim, and a future seam for coordinated full-resolution
  stills.
- Durable job model under the state dir: per-job directory with an
  atomically-written manifest, zero-padded frame sequence, explicit
  phases (capturing/stopped/rendering/complete/capture_failed/
  render_failed/interrupted). Frames are never deleted because
  something failed. Interrupted jobs are detected at startup and can
  auto-resume (`resume_interrupted`), so a daemon restart or
  `update.sh` doesn't silently kill a long capture.
- Storage guardrails: configurable output dir (point it at a mounted
  NAS to avoid SD wear entirely), free-space threshold checked at start,
  before every frame, and before rendering. No automatic retention
  deletion. Retrieval over SSH/scp is acceptable for now (web UI
  milestone adds browse/download; upload automation is candidate work).
- Rendering via ffmpeg at reduced priority with a watchdog timeout,
  serialized (one render at a time), output validated before a job is
  `complete`; failed renders keep all frames and can be retried.
  Encoder configurable (libx264 default; hardware `h264_v4l2m2m` as an
  option pending validation against live-stream encoder contention).
- Operable per the usability rule from CLI (`makereye timelapse
  start/stop/status/list/render`) and Home Assistant (start/stop/render
  buttons, interval and fps number entities for per-job parameters,
  phase/frames/failures/last-render sensors), all through the same
  daemon internals.
- Optional lighting hold: a job can pin a configured light at a
  brightness during capture and restore it after (plus HA automations
  can compose the Milestone 4 light entities freely).
- **Validated on real hardware** (Pi Zero 2 W): 292-frame capture with
  streaming and Prusa Connect uploads running, start/stop from Home
  Assistant, on-device libx264 render (~150s, playable MP4). Findings
  folded back in: Prusa uploads now pause during renders (the
  CPU-saturated snapshot endpoint just timed out for the render's
  duration), and renders run under `ionice` as well as `nice`.
- **Remote rendering** (added post-validation): `scripts/
  makereye-render.sh` + `install-renderer.sh` render jobs on another
  Debian machine from a shared timelapse directory — one-shot per job
  dir, or a polling systemd watcher that renders jobs as their capture
  finishes (polling because inotify can't see cross-host changes on
  network shares). Recommended setup for Pi Zero class devices:
  `output_dir` on a NAS share, `auto_render: false`.

## Milestone 6 — Capture triggers — NOT STARTED

Rewritten after Milestone 5's hardware validation: interval capture
works, but for print timelapses it produces nozzle-bouncing-everywhere
video. Studio-quality print timelapses need frames captured at a
*moment the printer chooses* (end of layer, head parked), which
reframes the design from "printer timelapse" to a generic **capture
trigger** pipeline.

- `CaptureTrigger` abstraction: every trigger source produces the same
  `CaptureRequest{Reason, Time}` into the existing timelapse capture
  pipeline; the job subsystem doesn't know or care where a frame
  request came from. The current interval loop becomes just one
  trigger (`IntervalTrigger`), and a job is configured with a trigger
  rather than hard-coding the ticker.
- Planned trigger backends, in priority order:
  1. **GPIOTrigger (tier 1, the reference for print timelapses)**: a
     printer pin (e.g. Prusa's official GPIO hackerboard) pulses a Pi
     GPIO after the layer-change G-code parks the head. Deterministic,
     near-zero latency, no polling, matches the appliance philosophy.
  2. **USBSerialTrigger (tier 2, no extra hardware)**: the printer is
     connected over USB serial and layer-change G-code emits
     `M118 MAKEREYE_CAPTURE`; MakerEye watches the serial stream for
     the marker. Nearly as good as GPIO, needs only a cable.
  3. **MQTTTrigger / ManualTrigger**: a capture command topic and a
     CLI/HA "capture frame" button — free once the abstraction exists,
     and they make every other integration (HA automations, Node-RED,
     scripts) a trigger source.
  4. **PrusaLinkTrigger (tier 3, additive, not foundational)**: only if
     PrusaLink's API exposes a usable event stream; polling job state
     gives coarse start/stop automation, not per-layer precision. Never
     a dependency of the architecture.
- **Embrace custom G-code, don't treat it as optional**: ship an
  official PrusaSlicer "after layer change" snippet in the docs (M400
  to flush moves, park/wipe move, `M118 MAKEREYE_CAPTURE` or the GPIO
  pulse macro, small dwell), so setup is paste-one-snippet with no
  OctoPrint or plugins.
- Interval-based jobs (construction timelapses etc.) keep working
  unchanged; triggered jobs likely want auto-stop rules (idle timeout /
  explicit stop trigger) — design at implementation time.
- Config placeholder already present: `prusalink.enabled` (will be
  reshaped into trigger configuration).
- **Research needed at implementation time**: GPIO access from the
  unprivileged daemon (gpiochip character device + `gpio` group),
  serial-port sharing semantics if the same USB port ever serves both
  trigger input and lighting output, and debounce/edge handling.

## Milestone 7 — Local web interface — NOT STARTED

Moved ahead of motion/AI: it's the no-Home-Assistant answer to the
usability rule, and the last remaining reason to SSH in day-to-day is
editing `config.yaml`.

- Small appliance-style UI served by the daemon: status (stream, Prusa
  Connect, lighting, timelapse), live view (embed/link go2rtc's stream
  endpoints), config viewing and editing with the existing validation
  (reject-on-invalid, never silently rewrite), timelapse
  browsing/download.
- No heavy frontend framework without a clearly compelling reason —
  default assumption is server-rendered Go templates and a tiny amount
  of vanilla JS.
- Security design question to answer at implementation time: auth story
  for the UI (reuse `go2rtc.auth`? separate credential?) and safe
  defaults for its listen address (loopback-only by default, same as
  go2rtc, with the same documented LAN-exposure tradeoffs).

## Milestone 8 — Motion-triggered operation — NOT STARTED

- Scope note (per design priority #2): once MQTT exists, motion-driven
  behavior can often be composed in Home Assistant (or by pointing a
  motion-capable NVR like Frigate at MakerEye's RTSP stream). This
  milestone is for on-device detection where none of that infrastructure
  exists.
- Sustained motion as a generic "start a job" trigger (for non-Prusa
  maker equipment), publishing MQTT events HA can react to.
- Configurable idle timeout to stop.
- Stay focused on maker-equipment use cases, not general surveillance
  features (no face detection, no zones UI, etc.).
- Config placeholder already present: `motion.enabled`.
- **Research needed at implementation time**: detection approach —
  frame-diff on go2rtc's stream vs. a dedicated capture path, evaluated
  against whatever go2rtc/rpicam capabilities look like then, and
  against the Pi Zero 2 W's CPU budget while encoding.

## Milestone 9 — AI monitoring — NOT STARTED

- Local print-failure detection (spaghetti detection, etc.).
- Publish advisory events first (MQTT event → HA notification); local
  printer pause control is a later, explicitly-opt-in step, not part of
  the initial AI milestone.
- Config placeholder already present: `ai.enabled`.
- **Research needed at implementation time**: what actually runs
  acceptably on a Pi Zero 2 W (if anything) vs. requiring a more capable
  Pi or an off-device inference option — may change the hardware story
  for this milestone specifically.

## Candidate work, not yet scheduled

- **ONVIF / UniFi Protect compatibility — IMPLEMENTED, HARDWARE VALIDATION
  PENDING**: native `internal/onvif` WS-Discovery plus authenticated device
  and media SOAP services advertise the existing go2rtc RTSP stream as one
  H.264 profile. Unit tests cover discovery responses, WS-Security digest,
  endpoint generation, and configuration guardrails. Still required on a
  real Protect console: automatic discovery, credentialed adoption,
  continuous recording, reconnect after restart, and confirmation that a
  single profile is acceptable for both HQ/LQ selection. Do not add an LQ
  transcode until that test demonstrates a need.

- **Update over MQTT/Home Assistant** (single-command update exists
  today: `scripts/update.sh` pulls/rebuilds/reinstalls/restarts). The
  full no-SSH version has a clean design but real moving parts, so it's
  recorded here rather than bolted onto Milestone 3:
  - HA's MQTT discovery supports an `update` entity: MakerEye would
    publish its installed version plus the latest available (upstream
    `main` commit, or a release tag once releases exist), and HA shows
    an "Update" card with an install button like any other device.
  - Privilege separation is the crux: the daemon runs as the
    unprivileged `makereye` user and must not gain root. Sketch: the
    daemon writes a trigger file under `/var/lib/makereye`; a
    root-owned `makereye-update.path` systemd unit watches it and
    starts a oneshot `makereye-update.service` that runs
    `scripts/update.sh`. No sudo rules, no polkit, auditable via
    journald.
  - "Latest available" needs a source of truth: polling the GitHub API
    or `git fetch` on a timer. Fits naturally with the roadmap's
    existing "install from published release binaries" future item,
    at which point this becomes "compare tags, download binary" with
    no on-device rebuild.
- **Scheduled auto-update** (systemd timer running `scripts/update.sh`
  nightly): trivially enabled once wanted, but deliberately not the
  default — during active development an unattended pull can break the
  camera while nobody is watching; user-triggered updates (button in
  HA per the above) are the intended model.
- **Automatic timelapse upload**: push completed renders (and
  optionally frames) to Proton Drive, Nextcloud, or a NAS share.
  Intended design: shell out to `rclone` as the transport (same
  philosophy as ffmpeg-for-encoding — rclone covers WebDAV/Nextcloud,
  SMB, and is the only maintained Proton Drive path) rather than
  implementing per-provider clients.
- **Managed NAS mounts**: MakerEye configures the NAS mount itself from
  `config.yaml` (share address, credentials, mount point), with
  `scripts/install.sh` installing the required packages (`cifs-utils`
  or nfs client), so pointing `timelapse.output_dir` at network storage
  is a config edit instead of a manual fstab/systemd-mount exercise.
  Doubles as the SD-wear answer: capture frames straight to the NAS.
  Possibly its own milestone; depends on the upload item's fate.

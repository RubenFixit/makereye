## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Optional ONVIF integration for third-party NVRs such as UniFi Protect:
  native WS-Discovery, device/media SOAP services, WS-Security UsernameToken
  and HTTP Digest authentication, and one H.264 profile pointing at
  MakerEye's existing go2rtc RTSP stream. The feature is disabled by default and does not create
  another camera capture or encode pipeline. Protocol behavior is unit
  tested; adoption against real Protect hardware remains to be validated.

- Device telemetry over MQTT (`internal/sysinfo`): OS/kernel version,
  CPU usage averaged over the publish interval, memory usage and
  available MB, CPU temperature, root and capture-directory disk
  usage/free GB, Wi-Fi signal (link quality/interface as attributes),
  and uptime (human-readable attribute), published every 30s as HA
  diagnostic sensors; plus diagnostic binary sensors for capture
  storage low (config threshold), undervoltage, CPU throttled (Pi
  firmware flags with has-occurred attributes), and system clock
  synchronization. The MakerEye version stays the HA device's firmware
  field rather than duplicating as a sensor.
- Remote timelapse renderer: `scripts/makereye-render.sh` renders jobs
  from a shared timelapse directory on any Debian machine (one-shot per
  job, or a polling systemd watcher installed by
  `scripts/install-renderer.sh` that renders jobs as capture finishes).
  Reads/updates the same job manifests atomically, never deletes
  frames, and marks failed renders without hot-looping.
- Device-wide error visibility in Home Assistant: a "Last command
  result" sensor reporting the outcome of every MQTT-initiated command,
  and a "Last error" sensor showing the newest runtime error from any
  subsystem (stream, Prusa Connect, timelapse; errors are now
  timestamped internally so "newest" is well-defined). Found during
  hardware validation: failures previously went only to journald.
- Milestone 5: manual timelapse (`internal/timelapse`). One capture job
  at a time from the shared snapshot source, durable per-job state
  (atomic manifests, zero-padded frame sequences, never deleting frames
  on failure), automatic resume of jobs interrupted by
  restarts/updates, free-space guardrails, and serialized ffmpeg
  rendering with a watchdog and validated output. CLI:
  `makereye timelapse start/stop/status/list/render`; Home Assistant:
  start/stop/render buttons, interval/fps number entities, and job
  sensors. New `internal/snapshot` package shared with the Prusa
  uploader, which now also validates that captured frames are decodable
  JPEGs before uploading.
- Milestone 4: lighting framework (`internal/lighting`) with the Wyze
  Cam v3 Spotlight Kit as the first backend. Configured under
  `lighting:` as a list of typed lights; controlled via
  `makereye light <name> <0-255|on|off>` and, with MQTT enabled, as
  dimmable Home Assistant light entities. Advisory subsystem: unplugged
  lights are logged and recover on the next command. The Go backend
  disables tty output post-processing, fixing frame corruption for
  brightness levels containing byte 0x0A that the reference shell
  script couldn't send.
- `scripts/update.sh`: single-command update for a device installed
  from a git checkout — pulls the current branch, rebuilds, reinstalls
  via `install.sh` (so new dependencies are picked up), restarts the
  service, and prints status. Never touches an existing config.
- Milestone 3: optional MQTT + Home Assistant integration
  (`internal/mqtt`). With `mqtt.enabled` and a broker configured,
  MakerEye publishes availability (LWT), state/telemetry, and appears
  in Home Assistant automatically via MQTT discovery: stream and Prusa
  Connect switches, restart buttons, and status sensors, all driving
  the same daemon internals as the CLI. Advisory subsystem: a down
  broker is retried in the background and never affects streaming.
  First dependency beyond yaml.v3: `eclipse/paho.mqtt.golang`.
- `scripts/spotlight_ctl.sh`: standalone brightness control (0-255) for a
  Wyze Cam v3 Spotlight Kit accessory driven directly over the Pi's USB
  OTG port. Not wired into `config.yaml`/the daemon, an experiment kept
  as a utility script; see `ROADMAP.md`'s Milestone 4 (Lighting) for
  the planned native integration.
- Milestone 2: Prusa Connect snapshot uploads. `internal/prusaconnect`
  captures a JPEG from go2rtc's own snapshot endpoint and PUTs it to
  Prusa Connect on an interval (`prusa_connect.token`/`fingerprint`/
  `interval_seconds`). CLI: `prusa start/stop/restart`; `makereye status`
  reports upload/failure counts; `makereye validate-config` reports
  enabled/disabled without printing the token. Token stored as plaintext
  in `config.yaml` for the same reason as `go2rtc.auth.password` (Prusa
  Connect needs the literal credential). Validated against a real Prusa
  Connect account/camera, see `ROADMAP.md`.
- Milestone 1: optional `go2rtc.auth.username`/`password` config, passed
  through to go2rtc's own RTSP and HTTP API (WebRTC/MJPEG/snapshot) auth
  for LAN-exposed setups. Stored as plaintext by design (go2rtc needs the
  literal credential to authenticate clients, not a hash of it); both
  `config.yaml` and the generated go2rtc config remain
  `0640 makereye:makereye`. `makereye status` prints URLs with
  credentials embedded (noted as sensitive output);
  `makereye validate-config` reports auth on/off without the password.
- Milestone 0: repository foundation, Go module
  (`github.com/MakerEyeLabs/makereye`), GPLv3 license, `.gitignore`,
  README/DESIGN/ROADMAP docs, example config, systemd unit, install/
  uninstall scripts, Makefile, build-time version support.
- Milestone 1: camera streaming, `makereye` daemon manages a Raspberry
  Pi Camera Module 3 pipeline (`rpicam-vid`) exposed via go2rtc (RTSP,
  WebRTC, MJPEG, snapshot). CLI: `run`, `version`, `validate-config`,
  `status`, `stream start/stop/restart`. Config validation with
  actionable errors. Bounded restart behavior for the go2rtc supervisor.
- `scripts/bootstrap.sh`, installs build-time dependencies (git, make, a
  Go toolchain matching `go.mod`) missing from stock Raspberry Pi OS
  Lite, so a fresh Pi can go from `apt-get install git` to a built
  binary without manually chasing down each prerequisite.
- `scripts/quickstart.sh`, chains a clone/pull of this repo with
  `bootstrap.sh`, `make build`, and `install.sh` so the whole install is
  a single `curl | sudo bash` command; re-running it pulls the latest
  commit instead of re-cloning.

### Changed

- Restructured `ROADMAP.md`: added explicit design priorities (everyday
  use without a terminal — one-time SSH setup is fine, Home Assistant
  as the automation surface, lighting as part of image quality with a
  pluggable-backend framework), rewrote the contributor guidelines
  around keeping `main` releasable with feature work in branches,
  reordered the remaining milestones (MQTT/Home Assistant → lighting →
  manual timelapse → PrusaLink timelapse → web UI → motion → AI), and
  moved the "future research questions" into the milestones they belong
  to. Placeholder config sections were renumbered to match.

### Fixed

- `scripts/install.sh` was missing `ffmpeg` from the installed apt
  packages. go2rtc shells out to it for several internal code paths
  (transcoding, some snapshot/recording sources) even though MakerEye's
  own `exec:rpicam-vid` source doesn't call it directly; without it,
  those go2rtc code paths failed. Found during real hardware validation.

### Known limitations

- Not yet fully validated against real Raspberry Pi hardware, see
  `docs/NEXT_SESSION.md` and the "Hardware validation" section of
  `README.md`.
- go2rtc endpoints (RTSP/WebRTC/MJPEG/snapshot) have no authentication by
  default; default config binds them to loopback only. Optional
  username/password auth is available (see `README.md` "Network exposure
  and security") but is off unless explicitly configured.
- Milestones 3-9 (MQTT/Home Assistant, lighting, timelapses, PrusaLink,
  web UI, motion detection, AI monitoring) are not implemented; see
  `ROADMAP.md`.

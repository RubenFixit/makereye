# MakerEye Design

This document records the architecture and design decisions for MakerEye,
for humans and for future Claude Code sessions picking up this project
without prior conversation history. It is a living document, update it
when architecture decisions change.

See `ROADMAP.md` for milestone status and `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for the
developer workflow.

## Product summary

MakerEye is a lightweight Go daemon that turns a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W +
Camera Module 3 running stock Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit into a
purpose-built monitoring appliance for a 3D printer (Prusa-first, not
Prusa-only). It deliberately stays small enough for one maintainer: no
plugin framework, no custom OS image, no NVR-scale feature set.

## Process ownership

**MakerEye launches and supervises go2rtc directly as a child process.**
This was chosen over the alternative (go2rtc as its own systemd unit,
configured by MakerEye) for Milestone 1:

- One systemd unit (`makereye.service`) is the only thing that needs to
  start correctly, be enabled, and be monitored by an operator or by
  `systemctl`. There is no second unit to keep in sync, no ordering
  dependency between two units to get wrong, and no window where go2rtc
  is running with a stale config MakerEye already moved past.
- MakerEye can react immediately to camera/stream configuration changes by
  restarting go2rtc itself, rather than shelling out to `systemctl
  restart go2rtc` (which would require sudo/policykit wiring for a
  non-root MakerEye process, or running MakerEye as root against systemd
  unnecessarily).
- `stream start/stop/restart` in the CLI has one clear owner to talk to:
  the running `makereye run` process, over a local control socket (see
  below), rather than needing to reconcile MakerEye's idea of state with
  systemd's.
- The go2rtc process is not exposed as an independently
  restart-on-boot-able systemd unit, which matches the actual usage
  pattern: go2rtc without MakerEye's generated config and supervision is
  not useful on its own in this appliance.

The tradeoff is that MakerEye's own crash takes go2rtc down with it (no
independent systemd `Restart=` for go2rtc). This is accepted: MakerEye's
process itself is a thin supervisor with a small state machine and no
long-running blocking work in its main loop, so it is not expected to
crash independently of go2rtc. `makereye.service` has
`Restart=on-failure`, so if the whole thing does go down, systemd brings
the pair back up together.

**Do not introduce a second service-management mechanism** (e.g. don't
also let go2rtc run as `go2rtc.service` in parallel with MakerEye trying
to launch it). If a future milestone needs go2rtc to survive a MakerEye
crash independently, that requires revisiting this decision explicitly
here, not adding an alternate path alongside it.

## Camera pipeline

```
rpicam-vid (child of go2rtc, via "exec:" source)
    │  raw H.264 Annex-B over stdout pipe
    ▼
go2rtc (child of makereye)
    │  RTSP / WebRTC / MJPEG / snapshot
    ▼
clients (VLC, browser, Prusa Connect uploader in Milestone 2, etc.)
```

- MakerEye renders a go2rtc YAML config (`internal/go2rtc.Render`) whose
  single stream source is `exec:rpicam-vid <args>`. go2rtc launches and
  owns that subprocess itself; MakerEye never talks to rpicam-vid
  directly. This keeps camera access exclusive to a single process chain
  and avoids two tools fighting over `/dev/video*`.
- `rpicam-vid` is used, not the legacy `raspivid`. Raspberry Pi OS Lite
  64-bit ships `rpicam-apps`; `libcamera-vid` etc. are compatibility
  symlinks to the same tool on current images.
- The command line is built by `internal/camera.BuildArgs`, a pure
  function from `config.CameraConfig` to an argument list, this is what
  is unit tested (no hardware required); only the resulting subprocess
  execution is untested without a real Pi + camera.
- On a Raspberry Pi 5, go2rtc's wiki notes `rpicam-vid`'s default output
  format detection breaks and requires `--codec libav --libav-format
  mpegts` instead of raw `--codec h264 --inline`. MakerEye's initial
  target is the Pi Zero 2 W, where the simpler raw H.264 Annex-B pipe
  (what MakerEye generates) is the documented, working approach. If a Pi
  5 target is added later, this will need to become pipeline-model-aware.

## Relationship between MakerEye, rpicam-vid, and go2rtc

- MakerEye: process supervisor + config authority. Generates go2rtc's
  config from MakerEye's own YAML config, starts/stops/restarts the
  go2rtc process, reports health, serves the local control socket for the
  CLI.
- go2rtc: the actual streaming server. Owns the rpicam-vid subprocess,
  demuxes/repackages the H.264 stream for RTSP/WebRTC/MJPEG/snapshot
  consumption, handles client connections. MakerEye does not reimplement
  any of this.
- rpicam-vid: camera capture only. Never launched or managed by MakerEye
  directly, always a go2rtc-owned child process.

## ONVIF facade

`internal/onvif.Server` is an optional in-process discovery and metadata
facade around the existing go2rtc RTSP stream. It does not read camera
frames, proxy RTSP, or create a second encoder. It owns two listeners:

- WS-Discovery multicast on the standard IPv4 endpoint
  `239.255.255.250:3702`, answering Probe and Resolve requests with a stable
  device UUID derived from the host machine ID and `device.name`.
- An HTTP SOAP endpoint implementing the ONVIF device and media operations
  needed to enumerate one H.264 profile and obtain its RTSP URI.

MakerEye implements this facade rather than exposing go2rtc's built-in
ONVIF endpoint because go2rtc v1.9.14 does not advertise that endpoint as a
discoverable ONVIF device, and its ONVIF requests share the HTTP API's Basic
authentication boundary. MakerEye instead verifies ONVIF WS-Security
UsernameToken credentials independently while keeping the go2rtc HTTP API
on loopback.

The ONVIF and go2rtc RTSP credential pairs are required to match. Protect
uses the credentials entered at adoption when it subsequently opens the
advertised RTSP URI; allowing different pairs would produce an appliance
that discovers and authenticates successfully but cannot stream. ONVIF is
advisory at the daemon level: failure to bind its listener is logged without
taking down local camera streaming.

Only one media profile is advertised initially. A distinct LQ profile would
require a derived/transcoded stream and consumes scarce Pi Zero 2 W
resources, so it is deferred until real Protect validation shows whether it
is necessary.

## Prusa Connect uploader

Unlike go2rtc, `internal/prusaconnect.Uploader` is **not a subprocess**,
it's a goroutine inside the MakerEye process itself (`Start`/`Stop`
manage a context-cancelled loop, not an `exec.Cmd`). There's no external
binary to supervise, restart-loop, or health-check, it's just a periodic
HTTP client, so the go2rtc `Supervisor`'s process-lifecycle machinery
(backoff schedule, crash-loop detection, `PhaseFailed`) doesn't apply and
wasn't reused: a failed upload just gets retried on the next
`interval_seconds` tick, logged via `State.LastError`/`FailureCount`,
never a "give up" state. This is deliberate: uploads are advisory, not
something camera streaming depends on, so there is nothing to protect by
escalating retry backoff the way a crash-looping subprocess would need.

Each tick does two HTTP calls:

1. `GET http://<go2rtc.http_listen>/api/frame.jpeg?src=<stream.name>` —
   go2rtc's own snapshot endpoint, the same one `makereye status` prints
   for external clients. This is always a same-host call to MakerEye's
   own configured `go2rtc.http_listen`, sent with HTTP Basic Auth
   whenever `go2rtc.auth` is set, exactly like an external client would
   need, rather than relying on go2rtc's separate "requests from
   localhost skip auth" behavior, which is keyed on the request's source
   address, not on whether go2rtc's listener happens to be bound to
   loopback, and so isn't reliable to depend on if `go2rtc.http_listen`
   is ever a LAN address rather than `127.0.0.1`.
2. `PUT https://webcam.connect.prusa3d.com/c/snapshot` — Prusa Connect's
   webcam ingestion endpoint (a fixed constant, not user-configurable;
   there's no self-hosted Prusa Connect to point at instead), with
   `token`/`fingerprint` headers and the JPEG body. Header names/values
   and the endpoint itself came from a working reference script the
   project owner had used previously against the real API, not from
   Prusa's primary documentation (see `ROADMAP.md`'s former "Future
   research questions" entry for this, now resolved).

## MQTT + Home Assistant bridge

`internal/mqtt.Bridge` is the third advisory in-process subsystem
(after the Prusa uploader): a goroutine owning a paho MQTT client, not
a supervised child process. It MUST NOT be required for core operation
— the daemon starts and streams normally with the broker down, paho
retries in the background indefinitely, and a bridge startup error is
logged rather than failing `daemon.Run`.

- **Decoupling**: the bridge takes a `Hooks` struct of plain functions
  (stream/prusa start/stop/restart + a `Status` snapshot getter) that
  the daemon wires to the same internals the control socket uses. The
  bridge doesn't import `go2rtc`/`prusaconnect`, and MQTT commands are
  a third front-end (CLI, control socket, MQTT) to one set of
  operations, not a parallel implementation.
- **Topics**: MakerEye's own state lives under
  `<topic_prefix>/<device-slug>/...` (availability with LWT, a JSON
  status document, per-switch ON/OFF state topics, command topics).
  Home Assistant discovery configs are published retained under HA's
  `<discovery_prefix>` on every (re)connect, so both HA restarts and
  broker restarts converge without manual steps.
- **Acknowledgement model**: after any MQTT-initiated command the
  bridge republishes state immediately; a 30s refresh tick covers
  missed messages. Commands run with a 15s timeout.
- **Connection state honesty**: `Bridge.Connected` uses paho's
  `IsConnectionOpen`, not `IsConnected` — the latter also reports true
  while a reconnect is merely pending, which made `makereye status`
  claim "connected" against a down broker during testing.
- **Testing**: paho's `Client` is already an interface, so tests
  substitute a fake client and invoke the OnConnect handler directly —
  no broker needed, same boundary-faking philosophy as the go2rtc
  supervisor tests.

## Lighting

`internal/lighting.Manager` is another advisory in-process subsystem:
named lights with pluggable backends behind a one-method interface
(`SetBrightness(0-255)`), controllable from the CLI (control socket
`light-set`) and, with MQTT enabled, as dimmable Home Assistant light
entities.

- **Framework, not a one-off**: each configured light has a `type`
  selecting its backend. First (only) backend: `wyze_spotlight`, the
  Wyze Cam v3 Spotlight Kit over USB serial. GPIO on/off, PWM-dimmed
  GPIO, and addressable LED strips are anticipated types; the config
  shape (list of typed lights) exists so adding them doesn't churn
  existing setups. The backend interface stays minimal until a real
  second backend needs more (color, effects).
- **Write-only hardware**: the Wyze spotlight's state can't be read
  back, so the manager tracks the last *commanded* brightness as the
  state of record, applies a configured `startup_brightness` at daemon
  start to put hardware in a known state, and remembers the last
  non-zero level so "on" restores the previous brightness.
- **Wyze serial details**: frame `aa 55 43 05 16 <level> 07 <sum_hi>
  <sum_lo>` (16-bit big-endian additive checksum, validated by the
  device; reverse-engineered against real hardware, see
  `scripts/spotlight_ctl.sh`). The device is opened per write, so an
  unplugged/replugged spotlight recovers on the next command with no
  reconnect logic. Output post-processing (`OPOST`) is disabled via
  termios before writing: ONLCR would rewrite any 0x0A byte in a frame
  to 0x0D 0x0A, silently corrupting the two brightness levels whose
  frame contains 0x0A -- the reference shell script has that latent
  bug; the Go backend does not.
- **Shutdown behavior**: `Stop` leaves lights in their current state on
  purpose. Turning everything off on daemon shutdown would flap the
  lighting on every service restart and update.

## Snapshot source

`internal/snapshot.Source` is the narrow abstraction over "give me one
JPEG frame now": it fetches from go2rtc's `/api/frame.jpeg` (loopback
mapping via `go2rtc.ClientHostPort`, Basic Auth when `go2rtc.auth` is
set), enforces a caller-supplied timeout, and validates the response is
a non-empty, structurally decodable JPEG (SOI marker +
`jpeg.DecodeConfig`) before returning bytes plus capture-time metadata.
Both the Prusa Connect uploader and timelapse consume it, so neither
depends on go2rtc HTTP details directly. It is deliberately not a
plugin framework — its one job is to be the seam where coordinated
full-resolution still capture can later slot in without touching job
logic.

## Timelapse

`internal/timelapse.Manager` runs at most one active capture job, with
durable on-disk state and rendering as a separate, explicitly-requested
or auto-triggered step. Advisory like the other subsystems: nothing
here can take down streaming.

**Job model.** A job = ID (UTC timestamp + random suffix), user-visible
name, capture interval, playback fps, timestamps, phase, frame/failure
counters, last error, and paths. Phases: `capturing`, `stopped`,
`rendering`, `complete`, `capture_failed`, `render_failed`,
`interrupted`. A failed individual capture is recorded and retried next
tick; **`capture_failed` is entered only after 10 consecutive
failures** (bounded, like the go2rtc supervisor's restart policy) or
when the free-space threshold is hit — in both cases capture stops
cleanly and every captured frame is preserved.

**Capture loop.** One goroutine per active job reading a monotonic
ticker (injectable for deterministic tests), so capture times don't
drift by the duration of each snapshot request and overlapping ticks
are structurally impossible (a slow capture simply drops missed ticks).
The first frame is captured synchronously at job start, which doubles
as the "is the stream actually up" check — start fails cleanly if it
isn't. Free space is verified before every frame write.

**Persistence and recovery.** Layout under
`<output_dir>/<job-id>-<sanitized-name>/`: `job.json` (manifest),
`frames/00000001.jpg`..., and the rendered `<name>.mp4`. Manifests are
written atomically (temp file + rename + fsync); frames are written
atomically but not fsynced — losing the final frame on power cut is
acceptable, per-frame fsync grinds SD cards. The manifest is persisted
on every phase transition and every 10th frame; on load the frame count
is reconciled by counting files on disk, so the manifest being a few
frames stale is harmless. At daemon startup all manifests are scanned:
finished jobs are indexed, and jobs that were `capturing` are either
resumed (`timelapse.resume_interrupted`, default true — frame numbering
just continues, so `update.sh` restarts don't kill long captures) or
marked `interrupted`, from which they can still be rendered. Frames are
never deleted because capture stopped unexpectedly or a render failed.
No wall-clock trust: the Pi has no RTC, so timestamps are informational
only, never used for scheduling.

**Storage guardrails.** `output_dir` defaults to
`<state_dir>/timelapses` and may point anywhere — including a mounted
NAS share, which eliminates SD wear during capture. A configurable
minimum-free-space threshold is enforced at job start, before each
frame, and before each render; hitting it stops capture cleanly with an
actionable error. No automatic deletion of old jobs: retention that
silently removes user data is riskier than requiring explicit cleanup.

**Rendering.** ffmpeg (never encoding in Go), invoked through an
injectable command runner (tests use a fake; the real one runs ffmpeg
via `nice -n 19`). Defaults: H.264 MP4, `libx264 -preset ultrafast
-pix_fmt yuv420p`, playback fps from the job. `timelapse.encoder` can
select the Pi's hardware encoder (`h264_v4l2m2m`) — kept opt-in until
validated, because the hardware encoder may contend with the live
stream's own encoding. Renders are serialized (one at a time,
device-wide), bounded by a watchdog timeout
(`render_timeout_minutes`), and a job only becomes `complete` when
ffmpeg exits zero **and** the output file exists non-empty. Failure →
`render_failed`, frames intact, retry allowed via `timelapse render
<job-id>`. `retain_frames` (default true) may delete frames after a
*validated* successful render only. Rendering never runs concurrently
with capturing the same job.

**Lighting hold.** A job may optionally name a configured light and a
brightness to hold during capture; the manager records the light's
prior level at start and restores it when capture finalizes (wired
through daemon hooks to `internal/lighting`, no package dependency).
HA automations composing the Milestone 4 light entities remain the
more flexible alternative.

**Surfaces.** CLI `makereye timelapse start/stop/status/list/render`
over new control-socket commands; `makereye status` gains a concise
timelapse line. MQTT/HA (gated on `timelapse.enabled`): start/stop/
render-last buttons, `number` entities for per-job capture interval and
playback fps (defaults from config, values held by the bridge and
published retained), and sensors for phase/name/frames/failures/last
render outcome via the status JSON. State publishes on phase
transitions and the periodic refresh — deliberately not per frame or
per ffmpeg progress line, to keep MQTT traffic sane.

## Configuration model

- Format: YAML, single file, default path `/etc/makereye/config.yaml`,
  overridable with `-config` on every subcommand.
- `internal/config.Config` is the schema. `config.Default()` returns
  built-in defaults; `config.Load(path)` reads the file, decodes onto a
  copy of the defaults (so unset fields keep sensible values), and
  validates.
- Unknown top-level YAML keys are a hard error (`yaml.Decoder.KnownFields
  (true)`), so a typo in a section name fails loudly instead of being
  silently ignored.
- Validation (`Config.Validate`) collects *all* problems it finds and
  returns them together in one actionable error, rather than stopping at
  the first one.
- MakerEye never rewrites the user's config file. There is no "migrate
  config on startup" behavior and none should be added without deliberate
  design (it's a common source of surprising diffs and lost comments in
  appliance-style tools).
- **Resolved (Milestone 1/2)**: `go2rtc.auth.password` and
  `prusa_connect.token` live directly in `config.yaml` as plaintext, not
  in a separate tighter-permissioned file as this note originally
  floated. Reasoning: both go2rtc and Prusa Connect need the literal
  credential value to authenticate (see "Security considerations"), so
  hashing was never on the table; the remaining question was file
  permissions, not encryption. `config.yaml` is `0640 makereye:makereye`,
  and in the standard install (`scripts/install.sh`'s `create_user`) the
  `makereye` group has exactly one member, the `makereye` user itself, so
  a 0640 group-readable file and a hypothetical 0600 owner-only file
  protect the same set of principals today. A separate secrets file would
  only pay for itself if something later adds other members to the
  `makereye` group, at which point this should be revisited explicitly,
  not before. Splitting config now, for a threat that doesn't exist in
  the current install path, is exactly the kind of premature complexity
  this project avoids elsewhere (see `config.yaml`'s "never rewrites the
  user's config file" rule above, one file is easier to reason about).
  Future subsystems with their own credentials (MQTT, PrusaLink) should
  make this same call explicitly rather than assuming it, if the
  `makereye` group's membership assumption changes, revisit here first.

## Service model

- `makereye.service` runs `makereye run -config /etc/makereye/config.yaml`
  in the foreground (`Type=simple`).
- `makereye run`:
  1. Loads and validates config (exits non-zero with an actionable
     message on failure, this is treated as a configuration error, not a
     transient one, and systemd's `Restart=on-failure` loop would just
     repeat the same failure, so operators should notice via
     `systemctl status` / `journalctl` rather than relying on the retry
     loop alone).
  2. Creates its runtime/state directories if missing.
  3. Starts the go2rtc supervisor (`internal/go2rtc.Supervisor`), which
     writes the generated go2rtc config and launches the process.
  4. Serves the control socket (`internal/ipc`) at
     `<run_dir>/control.sock` for CLI commands.
  5. Blocks until SIGTERM/SIGINT, then stops go2rtc (SIGTERM, then
     SIGKILL after a grace period) and exits.
- Bounded restart behavior: if the go2rtc process itself exits
  unexpectedly, the supervisor retries with a fixed backoff schedule (1s,
  2s, 5s, 10s, 30s) and gives up after 5 consecutive rapid restarts,
  entering a `failed` phase that requires an explicit `makereye stream
  restart`. This avoids a tight restart loop hammering the SD card or CPU
  on a Pi Zero 2 W. A restart interval longer than 2 minutes resets the
  counter, so a long-lived process that eventually crashes once is not
  treated as part of a crash loop.
- `makereye stream start/stop/restart` and `makereye status` are CLI
  commands that talk to the *running* daemon over a Unix domain socket
  control protocol (`internal/ipc`), not separate process managers. This
  is why they require the daemon to already be running (`systemctl status
  makereye`), see `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for the local dev-loop
  implications.

| `/etc/systemd/system/makereye.service` | systemd unit                                     | root |

## Security considerations

- go2rtc's RTSP/WebRTC/MJPEG/snapshot endpoints have **no authentication
  by default**. The example config binds all of them to `127.0.0.1`
  only, which is the conservative default described in the install/
  README docs. Exposing them on the LAN (binding to `0.0.0.0` or a LAN
  address) is a deliberate user choice documented in `README.md`, not
  something MakerEye does by default.
- Optional auth (`go2rtc.auth.username`/`password` in `config.yaml`) is
  passed straight through to go2rtc's own HTTP Basic Auth (API) and RTSP
  auth, which MakerEye does not implement itself. The password is stored
  **as plaintext**, deliberately not hashed: go2rtc authenticates clients
  by comparing the submitted credential directly against this value and
  has no support for verifying a password hash, so hashing it in
  `config.yaml` would silently break authentication for every client
  rather than adding security. This is consistent with go2rtc's own
  upstream config, which also expects plaintext. Both `config.yaml` and
  the generated `/var/lib/makereye/go2rtc.yaml` are `0640
  makereye:makereye`; that filesystem permission, not a hash, is the
  actual protection on this credential at rest. See README.md
  "Network exposure and security" for user-facing guidance.
- `makereye.service` runs as a dedicated unprivileged `makereye` system
  user (in the `video` group for camera device access and `dialout`
  for USB serial lighting devices), not root.
  `NoNewPrivileges=yes` and `ProtectHome=yes` are set.
  `ProtectSystem=strict` plus an explicit `DeviceAllow=` list were
  considered but **not** used: the exact camera device nodes touched by
  libcamera/rpicam-vid vary across kernel/firmware versions, and an
  incomplete allow-list fails silently (camera just doesn't work, with a
  non-obvious cause). This should be revisited once validated against
  real hardware across a couple of Raspberry Pi OS releases.
- The control socket (`/run/makereye/control.sock`) is filesystem-permission
  protected (0660, `makereye:makereye`), not further authenticated. Any
  process running as the `makereye` user or root can issue stream or
  prusa start/stop/restart. This is acceptable for a single-tenant
  appliance.
- MakerEye does not shell out to arbitrary user-supplied commands.
  `internal/camera.BuildArgs` builds an argument list from typed,
  validated config fields (ints, bools, a closed set of enum strings) —
  there is no string concatenation of user input into a shell command.
  `exec.Command` is used with an explicit argv, not `sh -c`.
- `prusa_connect.token` and `mqtt.password` (in `config.yaml`) are
  stored as plaintext, the same reasoning and file permissions as
  `go2rtc.auth.password` above (Prusa Connect's API needs the literal
  bearer token, and the MQTT broker needs the literal password;
  hashing either would break authentication). See "Configuration
  model" above for why these live in `config.yaml` rather than a
  separate secrets file.
- Logs go to stdout/stderr only (journald captures them). Config values
  are logged sparingly and never include anything secret-shaped:
  `cmd_validate.go` prints whether `go2rtc.auth`/`prusa_connect` are
  enabled but never the password/token, and `cmd_status.go` only embeds
  credentials in the go2rtc stream URLs it prints (flagged as sensitive
  output there), never in log output.

## Known hardware assumptions

- Target: Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3, Raspberry
  Pi OS Lite 64-bit (arm64), a single camera per device (`camera: 0`).
- `rpicam-vid` and `libcamera` are assumed to be installed via
  `rpicam-apps` from the Raspberry Pi OS apt repositories (the installer
  does this). No custom driver or DKMS work is assumed.
- The Pi Zero 2 W's quad-core Cortex-A53 is capable of hardware H.264
  encode via the camera ISP pipeline for 1080p30 at the example config's
  bitrate; MakerEye does not do its own encoding or transcoding in this
  milestone (that stays in rpicam-vid/go2rtc).
- No hardware testing has been performed by the Claude Code session that
  wrote this version of MakerEye, see `docs/NEXT_SESSION.md` for exactly
  what still needs to be validated on real hardware, and README.md for
  the manual validation checklist an operator should run.
